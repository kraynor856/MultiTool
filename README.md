# MultiTool
A python Multi tool project that I am working on to test my pyhon skils, this tool will allow users to instal a range of softwares, e.g. nmap, aircrack-ng and more. I do want to add some sort of login system within the tool but at the moment, that can wait. If you see this code, feel free to rip into it, im very new to python. 


To do list: 
1. Add more softwares to the instal list. 
2. Add more sub menus 
3. Add some sort of port scanner
4. Add a option that allows the user to run a simple http server 
5. Add a login system (if needed)
6. Some sort of level system within the tool, if a user was to use the tool multiple times they can have points them points are shown on the main page of the too, this would require a login page for the users.
7. Add webpage support, have it so that the user can see or control the tool through the browser(if possible)
